// Level 2 – Functional Thinking & Logic Tasks (Intermediate)

// Write a higher-order function runTwice(fn) that takes another function and executes it two times.



// Create one pure function that always returns the same output for a given input, and one impure function using a global variable.



// Write a function that uses object destructuring inside parameters to extract and print name and age.



// Demonstrate the difference between normal function and arrow function when used as object methods (the this issue).



// Given an array of numbers, use map() to create a new array where each number is squared.



// Use filter() to get only even numbers from an array.



// Use reduce() to find the total salary from an array of numbers [1000, 2000, 3000].



// Create an array of names and use some() and every() to test a condition (e.g., all names longer than 3 chars).



// Create an object user and test the behavior of Object.freeze() and Object.seal() by adding/changing keys.



// Create a nested object (user → address → city) and access the city name inside it.
