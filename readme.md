# Day 41 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 39** in **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0**.  
It focuses on **basic functions**, **arrays**, and **objects**, helping to strengthen the foundational understanding of JavaScript syntax and logic through simple, beginner-friendly problems.

📌 **About the Day 39 Task**  
Day 39 was centered around learning and practicing **core JavaScript fundamentals** like functions, parameters, arrays, and object manipulation.  
The goal was to build a strong base in writing, calling, and structuring functions, while also experimenting with modern concepts like **default parameters**, **rest parameters**, and **IIFEs**.

✨ **Task Description**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Functions** | Created reusable blocks of code for printing, adding, and handling values. |
| **Default Parameters** | Used default arguments in functions for flexible input handling. |
| **Rest Parameters** | Implemented rest parameters to handle unlimited numbers dynamically. |
| **Nested Functions** | Demonstrated scope and closure using functions inside functions. |
| **Arrays** | Practiced adding, removing, and iterating through array elements. |
| **Objects** | Created and accessed objects using `for...in` loops to display key values. |
| **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** | Executed functions instantly upon definition. |
| **setTimeout()** | Introduced asynchronous execution using time delay functions. |

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For functions, arrays, and objects  
- **Browser Console / VS Code** – For testing and execution  
- **Node.js (optional)** – For running JS scripts locally  

## 🧩 Practice Questions

### Level 1 – Basic Function, Array and Object Code Tasks (Easy)

1. **Print “Hello JavaScript” using a simple function**  
   Demonstrates function creation and execution.

2. **Create a function that adds two numbers**  
   Uses parameters and returns/logs the sum.

3. **Use a default parameter `name = "Guest"`**  
   Prints a greeting message dynamically.

4. **Add unlimited numbers using rest parameters**  
   Uses `...nums` to handle variable arguments and calculate total.

5. **Implement an IIFE that prints a message instantly**  
   Demonstrates Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.

6. **Create a nested function accessing outer variable**  
   Shows the concept of lexical scope and closure.

7. **Manipulate an array of fruits**  
   Removes the first element and adds one at the end.

8. **Use a loop to print array elements**  
   Uses a `for` loop to iterate through an array.

9. **Create and iterate through an object**  
   Prints all key values using `for...in` loop.

10. **Use `setTimeout()` to display a message after 2 seconds**  
    Introduces asynchronous JavaScript and callback execution.

📖 **Learning Outcome**  
Through this task, I learned how to:  
- Write and execute **functions** effectively  
- Use **default** and **rest parameters** for flexibility  
- Understand **scope** and **closure** using nested functions  
- Manipulate **arrays** and **objects** using built-in methods and loops  
- Implement **IIFEs** for immediate execution  
- Apply **setTimeout()** for asynchronous behavior  
- Build a solid foundation for advanced JavaScript concepts  

🌟 **Acknowledgement**  
This task was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0** under the guidance of **Harsh Bhaiya**.  

It helped me strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript basics**, laying the groundwork for more complex problem-solving and real-world coding scenarios.
